LamboStake V1 has been launched on September 19th as the main product of [LamboSwap](https://app.lambodoge.org). 2 staking pools are available, `LDOGE/LDOGE` and `LP-LDOGE-BNB/LDOGE`,
with APYs of up to 5,000% and a TVL of almost $30,000.

Following the success of LamboStake V1, we are excited to announce its first major update, with a focus on scalability: **LamboStake V2**. We are targeting a launch on the Binance Smart Chain mainnet in early October.

LamboStake V2 introduces:

- **SP Maker:** Allowing the creation of its own staking pool, immediately available on LamboSwap.
- **Staking board:** The list of all available pools, with several sorting options to improve navigation.

These features will allow any project to add staking to their products, hence redirect their communities directly to LamboSwap. In exchange, our mission will be to offer them the best possible user experience.

# SP Maker (Staking Pool Maker)

A simple interface allowing anybody to create his own staking pool, just define the parameters of the pool, such as the tokens involved, the tax, the frequency of interest distribution etc... (The complete list of parameters is available [here](https://lambodoge.org/en/blog/introducing-lamboswap/#lambostake)).

In order to avoid abusive pools creation, `1 BNB` will be requested by the protocol. This money will directly go into our marketing fund.

# Staking board

The staking board concerns all users wishing to browse through the different available pools, with the possibility to sort them by TVL, by APY, or by creation date.

# Strategy

The goal of LamboStake V2, in addition to make DeFi more accessible, is to increase our visibility, raise funds for marketing through the pools creation fees, and most importantly to incentivise newcomers to hold LDOGE.

Regarding this last point, using a pool created through the **SP Maker** will require holding `5,000,000 LDOGE` (less than `0.1 BNB`). There are 4 ways to hold LDOGE:

- Directly on your wallet.
- Staked in the `LDOGE/LDOGE` pool.
- As liquidity on the `LDOGE/BNB` pair.
- As liquidity staked in the `LP-LDOGE-BNB/LDOGE` pool.

This way, you can freely dispose of your LDOGE bag and at the same time use the LamboStake V2 pools.

*The pool creation fee, and the minimum LDOGE quantity to hold can be updated.*
